# knn
This is a python library containing some basic functions that can be used to classfy a two-dimension dataset

*Note:* This is the first machine learning algorithm that I implemented. This project was finished by me in Sep 2018, which is a long time ago. If you are interested in implementation of this algorithm with more numpy and pandas stuff, you can go to [here](https://github.com/Simonliuwaterloo/algorithms/tree/master/machine_learning/KNN)
